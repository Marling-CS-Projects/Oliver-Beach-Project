# 2.2.4 Cycle 4: A goal / target

## Design

In this cycle I plan to make a central objective to the player. Some initial ideas I have come up with:&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This image shows the three game ideas I have right now: A ball of food that if the fish passes close too it eats, that could drop from the top and then rest in the middle of the screen.&#x20;

The second game would introduce a system where the food ball was controlled by the player, and the player had too evade a hunter, who was trying to eat the food.&#x20;

The third game would introduce a second fish, that chases the first off the screen. This would simulate a hunting behaviour, however would most likely require a new system of movement to be introduced.&#x20;

### Objectives

* [x] Decide on which style / feature of game I want to go for.&#x20;
* [x] Begin looking into the ways I am going to make that system fit into the game.&#x20;

### Usability Features

The game should look smooth, load quickly and not be complicated; I would like anyone to be able to look at the game and know what is happening, whilst still keeping it interesting.&#x20;
