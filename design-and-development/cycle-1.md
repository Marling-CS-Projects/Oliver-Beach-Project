# 2.2.1 Cycle 1

## Design

### Objectives

In this first cycle I decided to aim to make a colored background withgrad that would be interactable with and would show on the screen. I decided to use Replit for this due to the easy html, css and java script integration needed to make a web browser game. Replit is also an IDE, meaning I could see what my changes where doing to my game in real time.&#x20;

* [x] Color the background of the world
* [x] Create an interactable grid that can be clicked.&#x20;

### Usability Features

The game needs to be able to run **without crashing** and also allow for **player interactions** and **world interactions**.&#x20;
