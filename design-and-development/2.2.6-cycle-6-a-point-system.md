# 2.2.6 Cycle 6: A point system

## Design

In this cycle I plan to make a point system for the player, that will encourage seeking one thing. The current goal I have is to make the orange ball obtainable and give a plus one to a counter which will display the score.&#x20;

### Objectives

* [x] Make the orange ball obtainable&#x20;
* [x] Make it so when the orange ball is picked up the counter increases.

### Usability Features

The orange ball needs to move fast enough to be tough to pick up whilst also being possible to pick up for any player.&#x20;

### Key Variables

| Variable Name           | Use                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Counter                 | A variable I made to hold a score system                                                                     |
| Counter = 0 (On death)  | A system to reset the counter on death                                                                       |
| DistanceToOrangeEllipse | Measures how far the player is from the orange ellipse, then uses this to detect when there is a collision.  |

### Pseudocode

```
Game start
Create hunter
Create player
Create orb

When player collides with hunter 
    game over
    
when game over = true
    display game over screen
    hide all entities
    new game button
        if new game button = true
        show all entities
        hide game over screen
        
w a s d move player 
hunter chase player, if position < 5px kill

if player dist < 5 from orange
    counter + 1

display counter  

```

## Development

```javascript
// Check for collision between player and orange ellipse
    let distanceToOrangeEllipse = dist(player.moveX, player.moveY, x, y);
    if (distanceToOrangeEllipse < 20) {
        // Collision occurred with orange ellipse
        counter++; // Increment the counter

        // Move the orange ellipse to a new position
        x = width * noise(t);
        y = height * noise(t + 5);

        // Hide the orange ellipse temporarily
        noStroke()
        fill('lightblue');
        ellipse(x, y, 20, 20);

        // Wait for a brief moment 
        setTimeout(() => {
            // Reveal the orange ellipse
            stroke()
            fill('orange');
            ellipse(x, y, 20, 20);
        }, 3000); // 1000 milliseconds = 1 second delay
    }    
```

This was the first model. It created a collision box on the orange orb, that once collided with, removed the orange orb for as long as contact was maintained and then made it reappear when contact was broken.&#x20;

```javascript
// Global variables
let t;
let t2;
let slider;
let counter = 0; // Counter for collisions with orange orb
let newGameButton; // Declare newGameButton in the global scope
let orangeOrbVisible = true;

// Player object
const player = {
    moveX: 50,
    moveY: 50,
    speed: 5,
    up() {
        this.moveY -= this.speed;
    },
    down() {
        this.moveY += this.speed;
    },
    left() {
        this.moveX -= this.speed;
    },
    right() {
        this.moveX += this.speed;
    },
};

    t = 0;
    t2 = 0;

    // Create pause and resume buttons
    button = createButton("Pause");
    button.position(10, 10);
    button.mousePressed(noLoop);

    button2 = createButton("Resume");
    button2.position(70, 10);
    button2.mousePressed(loop);

    // Create a slider for movement speed
    slider = createSlider(1, 50, 10);

    // Initialize the hunter object
    hunter = {
        moveX: width / 2, // Start at the center
        moveY: height / 2, // Start at the center
        speed: 2, // Adjust as needed
    };

    // Create "New Game" button and hide it initially
    newGameButton = createButton('New Game');
    newGameButton.position(width / 2 - 50, height / 2 + 50);
    newGameButton.mousePressed(startNewGame);
    newGameButton.hide();
}

// Hunter chase behavior
function hunterChase() {
    let dx = player.moveX - hunter.moveX;
    let dy = player.moveY - hunter.moveY;
    let distance = sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);

    if (distance > 5) {
        hunter.moveX += (dx / distance) * hunter.speed;
        hunter.moveY += (dy / distance) * hunter.speed;
    }
}

// Draw function runs continuously
function draw() {
    background('lightblue');

    // Get slider value for movement speed
    let velo = slider.value() / 1000;

    // Calculate Perlin noise-based orb position
    let x = width * noise(t);
    let y = height * noise(t + 5);


    // Handle player movement based on key inputs
    if (keyIsDown(UP_ARROW) || keyIsDown(87)) {
        player.up();
    }

    if (distanceToOrangeEllipse < 20 && orangeOrbVisible) {
        // Collision occurred with orange ellipse
        counter++; // Increment the counter

        // Calculate a new position for the orange ellipse
        let newX = width * noise(t + 100);
        let newY = height * noise(t + 100);

        // Update the position of the orange ellipse
        x = newX;
        y = newY;

        // Hide the orange orb
        orangeOrbVisible = false;

        // Start a timer to show the orange orb again after a delay
        setTimeout(() => {
            orangeOrbVisible = true;
        }, 2000); // 1000 milliseconds = 1 seconds delay
    }

    // Draw the orange orb if it's visible
    if (orangeOrbVisible) {
        fill('orange');
        ellipse(x, y, 20, 20);

    ellipse(hunter.moveX, hunter.moveY, 30, 30);

    // Update time variables for Perlin noise
    t = t + velo;
    t2 = t2 + velo;

    // Display movement speed on the canvas
    textSize(20);
    text(velo, 5, height - 30);
    text('Movement speed', 5, height - 10);
}

// Fish facing left model
function fishLeft() {
    fill('white');
    stroke('black'); // Set the stroke color
    // Draw fish facing left
    triangle(player.moveX - 35, player.moveY + 20, player.moveX - 25, player.moveY, player.moveX - 35, player.moveY - 20);
    ellipse(player.moveX, player.moveY, 50, 15);
    fill('black');
    ellipse(player.moveX + 15, player.moveY, 5, 5);

    noStroke(); // Reset to noStroke

    newGameButton.hide();

    // Resume game loop
    loop();
}

```

This was the code in its entirety, with a working system that removed the orange orb when it was in contact with the player and then makes it reappear in a new location after a time period of 2 seconds.&#x20;

The next thing I need to work on is refining the code and making the transition smoother on pickup, possibly by changing the fish's hitbox, and most importantly displaying the counter, which should be easy as I have already set up a counter system and also made a refresh system when the player dies and "New Game" is displayed.&#x20;

```javascript
textSize(40);
    text(counter, 130, 30);
```

This was all that was required for the counter. This was thanks to my earlier work commenting code, allowing me to quickly find the section I had made about the counter and also the fact I had already implemented a counter on contact system as I was making the collision system, saving me considerable time here.&#x20;

### Outcome

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (13) (1).png>)

This is the counter at its base value. It is prominent and easily seen at the start of the game whilst also being unobtrusive near the other interactible buttons. However, when I hand the game to friends I reckon they may suggest changing it, especially its size or visibility.&#x20;

### Challenges

The first challenge was that when I wanted to make the stroke (outline) of the orb disappear to fully make it disappear, it also removed the outline of the fish.&#x20;

## Testing

The most noticeable error was that, when increased, the counter would move into the buttons.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (1) (1).png>)

This was fixed with a simple move of the counter, done by changing its x position so the two dont overlap anymore.
