# 2.2.7 Cycle 7: Point system affects difficulty

## Design

This cycle was dedicated to trying to make a system where picking up an orange orb adjusted the difficulty of the game, to stop games from lasting an infinite period of time. When picked up the counter would increase, which I hope will then be able to change the speed of the orb and possibly also the speed of the hunter.&#x20;

### Objectives

* [x] Make the orange ball change speed based on the amount of orbs picked up.&#x20;
* [x] Make sure everything is organized and separated so that no two things run off the same speed value.&#x20;

### Usability Features

I need to make it so that the game scales fairly. It is no fun if the game just suddenly becomes impossible, so I need to make it so that the game gets harder as more are picked up but doesn't become too difficulty too quickly, as it is meant to be accessible to all ranges of age.

### Key Variables

| Variable Name            | Use                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| orangeEllipseSpeedFactor | A variable created to manage the speed of the moving orange ellipse, also known as the scoring object.          |
| counter                  | Bringing back the counter as the speed scales off the counter value, so it needs to keep the counter accurate/  |

### Pseudocode

```javascript
Game start
Create hunter
Create player
Create orb

When player collides with hunter 
    game over
    
when game over = true
    display game over screen
    hide all entities
    new game button
        if new game button = true
        show all entities
        hide game over screen
        
w a s d move player 
hunter chase player, if position < 5px kill

if player dist < 5 from orange
    counter + 1

display counter 

orangeEllipse velocity = counter
hunter velocity = counter / 5
```

## Development

The main development here was just figuring out the best location for the speed change to be placed in the code. Too early and the game entered an infinite loop, as before drawing the stage it was increasing the velocity and therefore looping back to the start, or too late and the game increased in difficulty too slowly or the counter didn't change anything at all.&#x20;

```javascript
let distanceToOrangeEllipse = dist(player.moveX, player.moveY, x, y);
    if (distanceToOrangeEllipse < 20 && orangeOrbVisible) {
        // Collision occurred with orange ellipse
        counter++; // Increment the counter

        // Increase the speed factor of the orange ellipse when the counter increases
        orangeEllipseSpeedFactor += 0.001;
        
        // Calculate a new position for the orange ellipse
        let newX = width * noise(t + 100);
        let newY = height * noise(t + 100);

        // Update the position of the orange ellipse
        x = newX;
        y = newY;

        // Hide the orange orb
        orangeOrbVisible = false;

        // Start a timer to show the orange orb again after a delay
        setTimeout(() => {
            orangeOrbVisible = true;
        }, 2000); // 1000 milliseconds = 1 seconds delay
    }

    // Draw the orange orb if it's visible
    if (orangeOrbVisible) {
        fill('orange');
        ellipse(x, y, 20, 20);
    }

    velo = counter * orangeEllipseSpeedFactor / 5; // Update the overall game speed based on the counter
```

It is the last line of code that is the most important for this cycle, as it changes the velocity (what the game runs off of as the speed) to whatever the counter value is multiplied by the orange ellipse speed factor (what the orange orb is travelling at) divided by 5. Everything is seperated too keep it easy to understand and so that if in future I wanted to add something else, parts of the game could move at different rates, rather than all moving at an equally increasing pace.&#x20;

```javascript
velo = (counter * 2) / 1000
//  * orangeEllipseSpeedFactor / 5; // Update the overall game speed based on the counter
```

However what I ended up settling with was a version that god rid of the orange ellipse value, commenting it to keep it available for future need. The problem with it was how quickly the game became unplayable, as the multiplicative nature meant that the value quickly got out of hand. When I attempted to add them it got even worse, where after a counter of 2 the orb was teleporting around the map, completely unfair to the player and worse, un fun to play.&#x20;

### Outcome

The overall outcome is now that, when an orb is picked up, the speed of the orange orb increases. This makes it so that when the player is playing the game, the difficulty ramps up, keeping the player entertained as they have to constantly be improving.&#x20;

### Challenges

The biggest challenge was making it so that the difficulty was scaling as I had intended. The problem was that, if multiplied, it became near exponential where the beginning is now comically easy and past around 15 counter it was becoming impossible to chase and score, instead it was luck that it ran through the player.&#x20;

This made me create more variables that only led to confuse me and waste my time, as the variables didn't fix the problem and instead only made the game increase to the exponential point faster, as there were more things to be multiplied together (this is my current running theory).&#x20;

As you can see, score increases, so does the speed. At a score of roughly 8 I was having difficulty chasing the orb and at 10 I had to focus to predict where it would move, which hadn't happened in this game before. When at a score of 8 I died without meaning too, as I was so focused on the score I ran straight into the orb, as I was trying to circle around it. The hunter isn't too lethal but it will kill the unsuspecting player.&#x20;
