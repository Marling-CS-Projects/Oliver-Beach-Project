# 2.2.7 Cycle 7: Point system affects difficulty

## Design

This cycle was dedicated to trying to make a system where picking up an orange orb adjusted the difficulty of the game, to stop games from lasting an infinite period of time. When picked up the counter would increase, which I hope will then be able to change the speed of the orb and possibly also the speed of the hunter.&#x20;

### Objectives

* [ ] Make the orange ball change speed based on the amount of orbs picked up.&#x20;
* [ ] Remove the slider as the way to change the game speed
* [ ] Make the hunter speed scale fairly.

### Usability Features

I need to make it so that the game scales fairly. It is no fun if the game just suddenly becomes impossible, so I need to make it so that the game creeps upwards in difficulty, probably around the 15 to 20 obs obtained (score) that the game starts getting noticeably faster, and therefore harder.&#x20;

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use |
| ------------- | --- |
|               |     |
|               |     |
|               |     |

### Pseudocode

```javascript
Game start
Create hunter
Create player
Create orb

When player collides with hunter 
    game over
    
when game over = true
    display game over screen
    hide all entities
    new game button
        if new game button = true
        show all entities
        hide game over screen
        
w a s d move player 
hunter chase player, if position < 5px kill

if player dist < 5 from orange
    counter + 1

display counter 

orangeEllipse velocity = counter
hunter velocity = counter / 5
```
