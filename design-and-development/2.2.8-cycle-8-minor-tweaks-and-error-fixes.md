# 2.2.8 Cycle 8: Minor tweaks and error fixes

## Design

This cycle was focussed on trying to fix some of the noticeable bugs my game has, whilst also adding little quality of life details to just push the game up a little more. These changes will not particularly change the way in which the game is played, however they will hopefully improve the players experience in the game.&#x20;

### Objectives

* [ ] Add little tweaks and details
* [ ] Fix the ability to take the fish out of bounds on the edge of the map.&#x20;
* [x] Make it so that the player can die more than once after pressing the new game button.&#x20;

### Usability Features

I need to make it so that the game stays simple and I hope this cycle will not change that, instead this cycle will just build on what I have already created and hopefully improve the overall game experience.&#x20;

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use |
| ------------- | --- |
|               |     |
|               |     |

### Pseudocode

```javascript
Game start
Create hunter
Create player
Create orb

When player collides with hunter 
    game over
    
when game over = true
    display game over screen
    hide all entities
    new game button
        if new game button = true
        show all entities
        hide game over screen
        
w a s d move player 
hunter chase player, if position < 5px kill

if player dist < 5 from orange
    counter + 1

display counter 

orangeEllipse velocity = counter
hunter velocity = counter / 5

if player collides with border 
    bounce player 10 px
    
text align (center) // need to fix text placements in the game. 
```

## Development

First thing I decided I wanted to fix was the way in which the NEW GAME text on death was not centered. This type of fix doesn't change the gameplay in any way however I feel like it is a noticeable thing and takes away from the clean, "professional" game I have been attempting to create.&#x20;

```javascript
textAlign(CENTER, CENTER)
    fill('red');
    textSize(60);
    text('Game Over', (width / 2) - 170, height / 2);
```

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This is the original text, as you can see it is off centre. Whilst this doesn't change the gameplay in any way I feel like the change has a massive effect and helps make it look more serious.

```javascript
    stroke("white");
    fill('red');
    textSize(60);
    text('Game Over', (width / 2) - 170, height / 2);
```

This code centres the text, whilst having the new benefit of creating an outline that helps the text stand out on the black background.  Whilst it isn't perfectly centered, the nice thing about the change I made is that it works no matter the size of the window of the game, something that couldn't be said for all previous versions.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

And with the small addition of:&#x20;

```javascript
strokeWeight(5);
```

The game over text no longer has blurry borders and now looks like:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

My next fix was changing the way the death system worked, so that when the player died more than once they could keep playing. Currently if the player dies for the first time, the new game functions start, displaying the game over whilst also giving the option to click new game. Upon the new game button being pressed, the game resets to zero and allows the player to try again as expected. However what I later found out was that if the player then died on this second attempt, they did not get the option to press the new game button, but rather they were displayed with this screen:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The first death, correct</p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The second death, not correct</p></figcaption></figure>

This issue ruined the flow of the game as after every second death you had to reload the page, which on poor internet could cause buffering and disturb the player. Due to this I realised it needed to be fixed.

I first found the error that was causing this issue:&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

On the second death the game was no longer considering the gameOver as a function which meant it wasn't being called, resulting in the death screen and therefore new game not showing.&#x20;

The solution was simple and shown to me by a friend, I had to move the gameOver function into the draw function, so that it was constantly being checked. This is a good example of where my prior learning helped me with a new issue, as at the start of the project I had to do plenty research into the draw() function and I learnt how it updates each tick. Using this we realised that if the function was constantly being checked but not called then it would be ready to be called when it was needed.&#x20;

```javascript
// Draw function runs continuously
function draw() {
    background('lightblue');

    // Calculate Perlin noise-based orb position
    let x = width * noise(t);
    let y = height * noise(t + 5);


    // Handle player movement based on key inputs
    if (keyIsDown(UP_ARROW) || keyIsDown(87)) {
        player.up();
    }
    if (keyIsDown(LEFT_ARROW) || keyIsDown(65)) {
        player.left();
        fishFacingRight = false; // Fish is facing left
    }
    if (keyIsDown(RIGHT_ARROW) || keyIsDown(68)) {
        player.right();
        fishFacingRight = true; // Fish is facing right
    }
    if (keyIsDown(DOWN_ARROW) || keyIsDown(83)) {
        player.down();
    }
    
    // Game over function
    function gameOver() {
        // Display game over message
        background('black');
        stroke("white");
        fill('red');
        textSize(60);
        strokeWeight(5);
        text('Game Over', (width / 2) - 170, height / 2);

        // Disable player movement
        player.up = function() { };
        player.down = function() { };
        player.left = function() { };
        player.right = function() { };

        // Hide pause and resume buttons, show "New Game" button
        button.hide();
        button2.hide();
        newGameButton.show();
        orangeOrbVisible = false
        noLoop();
    }
    
    // Check for collision between hunter and player
    let distanceToHunter = dist(player.moveX, player.moveY, hunter.moveX, hunter.moveY);
    if (distanceToHunter < 20) {
        // Collision occurred, remove fish
        gameOver()
    }



    // Check for collision between player and orange ellipse
    let distanceToOrangeEllipse = dist(player.moveX, player.moveY, x, y);
    if (distanceToOrangeEllipse < 20 && orangeOrbVisible) {
        // Collision occurred with orange ellipse
        counter++; // Increment the counter

        // Increase the speed factor of the orange ellipse when the counter increases
        orangeEllipseSpeedFactor += 0.0005;

        // Calculate a new position for the orange ellipse
        let newX = width * noise(t + 100);
        let newY = height * noise(t + 100);

        // Update the position of the orange ellipse
        x = newX;
        y = newY;

        // Hide the orange orb
        orangeOrbVisible = false;

        // Start a timer to show the orange orb again after a delay
        setTimeout(() => {
            orangeOrbVisible = true;
        }, 2000); // 1000 milliseconds = 1 seconds delay
    }

    // Draw the orange orb if it's visible
    if (orangeOrbVisible) {
        fill('orange');
        ellipse(x, y, 20, 20);
    }

    velo = (counter * 2) / 1000
    //  * orangeEllipseSpeedFactor / 5; // Update the overall game speed based on the counter

    // Draw fish based on its direction
    if (fishFacingRight) {
        fishLeft();
    } else {
        fishRight();
    }

    // Update the hunter's position
    hunterChase();

    // Draw the hunter
    fill('black');
    ellipse(hunter.moveX, hunter.moveY, 30, 30);

    // Update time variables for Perlin noise
    t = t + velo;
    t2 = t2 + velo;

    // Display movement speed on the canvas
    textSize(20);
    text(velo, 5, height - 30);
    text('Movement speed', 5, height - 10);

    textSize(40);
    text(counter, 200, 30);
}
```

This means that the player can now die continuously without losing focus on the game.&#x20;



The next area I was going to tackle fixing was the problem of how the fish (player) could escape the camera and canvas by going off the side of the screen, becoming completely lost.&#x20;

&#x20;**VIEDEO EXAMPLE OF CURRENT PROBLEM**

This problem can be an annoyance to the majority of players as they just end up off the screen, but for a younger player who is likely to just hold one direction at some point, that run would be over as the player would get lost off the screen then possibly either die to the hunter or just never find their way back to the screen.&#x20;

This has been a problem in the game for a long time however it has not been a priority to fix it as it doesn't ruin the game unless the player leaves the screen. However it is finally time to fix the issue, so I came up with two options to fix the problem.&#x20;

<table data-full-width="false"><thead><tr><th>Invisible border at edge .</th><th>Teleportation to opposite side. </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Very visible when the player is at the edge of the screen. </td><td>Could be hard to learn at the start</td></tr><tr><td>Simple to add.</td><td>Tougher to add</td></tr><tr><td>Prevents the game from changing too much.</td><td>Adds new dynamics to the game</td></tr><tr><td>However:</td><td>However:</td></tr><tr><td>Less interactive</td><td>Much more interactive, allows the player to escape the hunter or catch up to the orange orb. </td></tr><tr><td>Less interesting / fun</td><td>Could be more fun, as the player unlocks new options.</td></tr><tr><td>Adds no new features / ideas. </td><td>Adds new potential to the game. </td></tr></tbody></table>

I could not decide between either of these two options so I decided I would make my decision after attempting to code them and seeing how it integrated with the rest of the game and also how smoothly it ran.&#x20;
