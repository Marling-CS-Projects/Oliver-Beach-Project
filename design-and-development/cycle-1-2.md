# 2.2.3 Cycle 3

## Design

This cycle is focussed on attempting to merge the random movement system of the Perlin dot with a hunting feature. This would create the feeling of two different animals living their lives individually until they met, at which point they would either hunt or be hunted.&#x20;

Another thing I would like to atleast attempt is trying to put one of the systems into the drawable background system, however I doubt this will work due to the difference between a **canvas** and a **map**. &#x20;

### Objectives

These are subject to change due to the difficulty of this cycle and the way in which I am unsure of whether the different codes will work together.&#x20;

* [x] Try and combine a random movement system to the hunt system.&#x20;
* [x] Try and set the background to a colour in my code.&#x20;

### Usability Features

The game needs to be able to run smoothly to allow the user to watch what is happening at a **smooth fps**.&#x20;

The game may not have much interactability at this stage but I would like for the player to be able to have an input, whether it be in regards to setting up the background or controlling the seek size, or the state of the game- paused or unpaused ie.&#x20;

### Pseudocode

    move vehicle noise (0, 8)

seek ()
    slider = 0, 50, 100
    if vehicle1 in vehicle2 ellipsis radius slider
