# 2.2.2 Cycle 2: Implementation System

## Design

This cycle focuses primarily on the way that the player will take something from a bar along the base of the screen, before then implementing said thing into one of the cells. I hope to have these things be such as a squirrel, a bush and a tree with possible water.&#x20;

### Objectives

The objective of creating water is a definite goal, but this cycle it may be difficult as I am still learning JavaScript and this requires making a cell "locked" to placement of other things- so that a squirrel can only travel on grass and trees, for example.&#x20;

* [ ] Create a taskbar that displays the things that can be placed down.&#x20;
* [ ] Allow the player to "grab" one of these things off the taskbar and place it into the world.&#x20;
* [ ] Create a system that only allows things to be placed in certain areas.&#x20;

### Usability Features

It needs to be a **simple feature** that allows the player to **see what is unlocked and what they can implement**.&#x20;

The player needs to be able to **fluidly implement** the things from the taskbar, including the **implementation of rocks and plants**.&#x20;
