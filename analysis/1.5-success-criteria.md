| 2        | Model design          | A low poly design for each thing implemented, either world plant or animal.                                                   | [Research (world design)](1.3-research-the-problem.md#world-design-and-art-style)                                  |
| 3        | Interactions (world)  | The world needs to be able to sustain the actions of the eco system on its own, changing the world design with some actions.  | [How the creatures interact with the world](1.3-research-the-problem.md#how-the-creatures-interact-with-the-world) |

### Non-functional

These are features which are not descriptions of functionality. They are more like suitability, such as age rating appropriateness, or performance of algorithms/response times for UI etc.
