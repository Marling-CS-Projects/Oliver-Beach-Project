| 1        | Implementing          | A simple feature that will allow the player to see what they can add to the world and what is locked                          | [Mechanics (implementation system)](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md)                                     |
| 2        | Model design          | A low poly design for each thing implemented, either world plant or animal.                                                   | [Research (world design)](1.3-research-the-problem.md#world-design-and-art-style)                                  |
| 3        | Interactions (world)  | The world needs to be able to sustain the actions of the eco system on its own, changing the world design with some actions.  | [How the creatures interact with the world](1.3-research-the-problem.md#how-the-creatures-interact-with-the-world) |
| 4        | Interactions (player) | The player needs to be able to interact with the world in a fluid manner to keep the game smooth and interesting              | [Interactions](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#interactions)                                             |
| 5        | Camera                | There needs to be a camera that can be moved around the world, with the ability to rotate.                                    | [Camera System](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#camera-system)                                           |
| 6        | World design          | A simple flat world that gives the player control over rock, water and plant placement                                        | [World design](1.3-research-the-problem.md#world-design-and-art-style)                                             |
| 7        | Collisions            | The animals need to collide with the plants and world, the player can't place entities inside each other.                     | [Animal interactions](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#animal-interactions)                               |
| 8        | Controls              | The controls will be a simple WASD to move the camera, mouse to click and place and q e to rotate.                            |                                                                                                                    |

### Non-functional

These are features which are not descriptions of functionality. They are more like suitability, such as age rating appropriateness, or performance of algorithms/response times for UI etc.
