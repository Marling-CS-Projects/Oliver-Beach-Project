| 1        | Implementing          | A simple feature that will allow the player to see what they can add to the world and what is locked.                                                                                              | [Mechanics (implementation system)](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md)                                     |
| 2        | Model design          | A low poly design for each thing implemented, either world plant or animal. Low poly means that it will have a low polygon count, implying simple textures and shapes.                             | [Research (world design)](1.3-research-the-problem.md#world-design-and-art-style)                                  |
| 3        | Interactions (world)  | The world needs to be able to sustain the actions of the eco system on its own, changing the world design with some actions made by both the player and the machine.                               | [How the creatures interact with the world](1.3-research-the-problem.md#how-the-creatures-interact-with-the-world) |
| 4        | Interactions (player) | The player needs to be able to interact with the world in a fluid manner to add the things from the implementation bar.                                                                            | [Interactions](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#interactions)                                             |
| 5        | Camera                | There needs to be a camera that can be moved around the world, with the ability to rotate.                                                                                                         | [Camera System](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#camera-system)                                           |
| 6        | World design          | A simple flat world that gives the player control over the placement of rocks, water and plant.                                                                                                    | [World design](1.3-research-the-problem.md#world-design-and-art-style)                                             |
| 7        | Collisions            | The animals need to collide with the plants and world, the player can't place entities inside each other. This is important as it makes the game a little more realsitic and helps the immersion.  | [Animal interactions](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#animal-interactions)                               |
| 8        | Controls              | The controls will be a simple WASD to move the camera, mouse to click and place and Q or E to rotate.                                                                                              |                                                                                                                    |

### Non-functional

These are features which are not descriptions of functionality. They are more like suitability, such as age rating appropriateness, or performance of algorithms/response times for UI etc.
