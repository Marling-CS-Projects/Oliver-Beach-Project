# 1.1 Problem Identification

During a tough period of everyone's lives in the form of the COVID-19 pandemic, people needed something to keep their spirits high, something to entertain and enjoy. "Around 30% of players appreciated the supportive role of video games during pandemic restrictions". In a time when the gaming industry is booming, raking in more and more money as more games are produced ([Kirkcaldy](../reference-list.md)) "Previous forecasts were estimating the video gaming industry to be worth $268 Billion by 2025." whereas due to the pandemic, "...were set to exceed 200 billion U.S. dollars in 2022." This is solely attributed to the way that: “The pandemic erased the weekends, leading people to play more year-round,” said "Przyblski" ([Health Policy Watch](../reference-list.md))

These graphs perfectly demonstrate what is shown: The market value increases steadily whilst the quantity of gamers also steadily increases. Whilst more people are playing games, free time wasn't the only thing affected. Peoples education was halted or at least slowed by the lack of face to face, social contact. Due to this, some teachers turned to using video games to help educate their students. "A [survey ](../reference-list.md)we conducted earlier this year found that almost half of the teachers in the U.K. and the U.S. have turned to gaming to try to engage their students during periods of virtual learning, with 91% claiming it's helped. ([Forbes](../reference-list.md)) For instance, the game Minecraft (which also had its most profitable year since its launch in 2009) has been incorporated into online learning curriculums in many mathematics classes, since it can help students practice building complex shapes, working out geometric problems, and manipulating blocks (Open Mic, 2021). One teacher from Quebec, Canada played Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey with his students in a series of remote learning sessions so they could not only see the Ancient Agora of Athens, but also experience what it would have been like to be there and to interact with others in their proper historical context ([Reinecke](../reference-list.md)).

Games are based on maths: the way objects interact and the way the games physics work, [Prodigy Games](../reference-list.md) provides free math games for students and schools: designed to engage students with math. Created for students in grades 1 through 8 (years one through nine), these games have been found to increase test scores. Video games are “the perfect way to teach math” and can help engage children in developing their math skills. ([Todd](../reference-list.md)).&#x20;

One study found that there was, on average, a 49 to 83% increase in maths skills from playing online math-based learning games (InterestingEngineering, 2023).  This same website recommends games such as "Tami's Tower", "Sudoku" and "Prodigy". ([McFadden](../reference-list.md)) Tami's Tower is a simple game with fun, childish graphics designed to introduce children to complex problems surrounding construction and physics. The player has to use a limited amount of blocks to reach a height, keeping the structure stable. I liked the idea of a simple game, one that was able to be understood by any, opening my age demographic and allowing me to reach a larger marketplace- tapping into the ever increasing industry.&#x20;
