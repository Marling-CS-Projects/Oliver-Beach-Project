# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Mechanics

### Implementation system

I believe a simple system will be best, allowing for a large player base that will include the PEGI rating I was going for, a 3 (possibly a 7). It will need to be simple for me to code correctly and also for the ease of the players. I believe a simple bar along the bottom of the screen will be the best option, with a menu system for the options between fauna or flora.&#x20;

## Limitations

### Limitation 1

Description of a limitation, due to scope/time constraints or difficulty of implementation.
