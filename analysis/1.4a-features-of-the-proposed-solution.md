# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Mechanics

### Implementation system

I believe a simple system will be best, allowing for a large player base that will include the PEGI rating I was going for, a 3 (possibly a 7). It will need to be simple for me to code correctly and also for the ease of the players. I believe a simple bar along the bottom of the screen will be the best option, with a menu system for the options between fauna or flora. This will keep the game screen looking simple and make sure that the main focus is on the ecosystem.

### Camera System

As of right now I believe the best camera option would be a stationary camera, set to be in the sky over the area the player chooses. This would ensure that there were no problems with the camera "losing" the main focus or the player getting lost with the camera and missing something important.&#x20;

On the other hand, I believe a good option could be a camera that could be moved around with a simple "WASD" movement system. This would allow for a much larger scale map, and possibly a wider variety in the amount of ways the game could be played. Whilst I believe this to be the best option in terms of how it would impact the game and the player, I believe it will make a difficult situation for me to code. The problems could be: An incorrect perspective if the camera moved away from an object could create a displeasing visual for the player, the world would have to be larger creating more potential area for glitches, animals would have to interact independently of where the camera is which means a potentially more demanding game, as things will have to being loaded off screen.&#x20;

### Difficulty system

I believe a simple difficult system could assist the game, something that ranges from easy to no assistance and that the player can decide from the moment that they start each new game

## UX/UI

### Taskbar and Implementation

This would be what the player would see whilst playing the game I believe the game will appear clear enough to be enjoyable. I believe the main thing I would change would be the location of the task bar, as it could be something that is only on screen if the player chooses to display it, for example at the press of the 'TAB' key so as to reduce the screen clutter and overall noise of the game. I want the game to be a relaxing and educational play, one that will both help educate any age and not bore anyone who wants to watch or play for fun.&#x20;

## Interactions

### Animal interactions

I believe the heart of the game will be watching the animals and how they interact with everything around them. I believe that getting this right is what I will be putting the majority of my time into. I feel like making sure that every animal has some niche requirements and interactions with the other animals will create a bond between the player and the animals, which may make the player want to play more or for longer. For example, a bird may be scared of a fox and its hunting ground, and could interact with other birds to warn them if the fox was nearby. This could be researched and then I could create a realistic system that accurately represents what happens in real life. I believe this will take a long time to think of the animals and their interactions with the world around them let alone other animals.&#x20;

### Plant interactions

I believe that the plants will be a vital part of the game and I hope to encourage the player to place as many as they would like, in strategically advantageous places so as to help the ecosystem. For example, from Equilinox, a bird making a nest in a tree to avoid danger, which also acts as its breeding ground and hunting ground. I believe there should be fruit trees and bushes alongside the normal variety, and these should feed the animals that live in an area around them from a "pool" of food that replenishes over time. This would mean that the pool could not support too many animals, promoting the player to be constantly planting new trees. In this same fashion could be a beaver, which uses trees to build its home, or a little mammal that digs plants up for their roots. These animals all "destroy" the ecosystem to feed themselves and this would mean that if the player didn't support the ecosystem then things would begin to fail. This also means the player will be having to pay close attention to what is going on, as I hope to use the difficulty settings to decide on how often to give the player a warning over the status of the ecosystem. For exmaple on easy it will tell the player when they are unbalanced whereas on hard it will only tell the player when they are pretty much dead to something sneaky- possibly a **disease** in certain plants.&#x20;
