# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Mechanics

### Implementation system

I will implement a simple system that will allow for a large player base that will include the PEGI rating I was going for, a 3 (possibly a 7). It will need to be simple for me to code correctly and also for the ease of the players. A simple bar along the bottom of the screen will be the best option, with a menu system for the options between fauna or flora. This will keep the game screen looking simple and make sure that the main focus is on the ecosystem.

### Camera System

As of right now I plan to implement a camera system that could be moved around with a simple "WASD" movement system. This would allow for a much larger scale map, and possibly a wider variety in the amount of ways the game could be played. This will be the best option in terms of camera systems as it would impact the game and the player, I believe it will make a difficult situation for me to code. The problems could be: An incorrect perspective if the camera moved away from an object could create a displeasing visual for the player, the world would have to be larger creating more potential area for glitches, animals would have to interact independently of where the camera is which means a potentially more demanding game, as things will have to being loaded off screen. To counter this, I will make simple models that will be easy for the player to understand what they are looking at whilst still being whole and not having any large clipping issues. I will implement a hitbox system that will have the camera "bounce" off any object it comes into contact with so that the player doesn't get stuck. &#x20;

### Help system

A simple help system could assist the game, something that ranges from easy to no assistance and that the player can decide from the moment that they start each new game. This help system would be key for younger players, giving them hints on what is going wrong and possible solutions to their current problem whereas for good players they could receive no assistance and rely on their own skill. This would allow players of all skill levels and understanding of the game to play and enjoy beyond their first playthrough.

This system would follow a simple live feedback system, where the game would have to check a current status of everything going on and then give the feedback. This could take a lot of time to code and so I will have to do more research into how to implement it, but I believe that the system would help expand the reach of the game and who can play it.&#x20;

## UX/UI

### Taskbar and Implementation

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>A simple mock up of the players UI I made</p></figcaption></figure>

This would be what the player would see whilst playing the game. The game should appear clear enough to be enjoyable, without a cluttered screen. The main thing I would adjust from the mock up would be the location of the task bar, as it could be something that is only on screen if the player chooses to display it, for example at the press of the 'TAB' key so as to reduce the screen clutter and overall noise of the game. The game should be a relaxing and educational play, one that will both help educate any age and not bore anyone who wants to watch or play for fun. Reducing the noise on the screen will help the player better focus on what is important, the interactions and environment.&#x20;

### Menu&#x20;

The game will have a simple menu that lets them choose whether to load a game, start a new game or go into the settings. The point of the menu is to give the player an easy and simple way to decide what they want to do and where they want to go without throwing them too deep into the game. It will also be the location of an information page, a place that will list the function of certain features of the game whilst also displaying simple tips whilst getting started.&#x20;

### Settings

An area that will display two areas: the controls and the simple settings. The simple settings will be the settings the player can adjust to change how the game appears to them, affecting their play. For example, a brightness slider or a volume slider could just help the player customise and control the game a little more.&#x20;

The controls section will allow the player to see the basic controls in the game, with a list of the key on the keyboard and then the function said key does. This will only have a small impact on the game but it will also enable many players to pick the game up without having to follow a guide to understand the controls.&#x20;

## Interactions

### Animal interactions

The heart of the game will be watching the animals and how they interact with everything around them. Getting this right is what I will be putting the majority of my time into, as making sure that every animal has some niche requirements and interactions with the other animals will create a bond between the player and the animals, which may make the player want to play more or for longer. For example, a bird may be scared of a fox and its hunting ground, and could interact with other birds to warn them if the fox was nearby. The most simple demonstration will be the requirements to spawn a new creature, for example: A kingfisher (requires a tree near water,  a large body of water with a fish tile and flowing water), a bear (requires a cave, berries and fish or other "prey" animals) and fish (requires a large body of water or a flowing river and a mating ground near food). This is just three demonstrations yet all depend on the environment around them and one another, meaning the game will have to be coded in a waterproof way, where one thing missing could ruin the entire game.&#x20;

&#x20;This could be researched and then I could create a realistic system that accurately represents what happens in real life. This will be a considerable chunk of my project, to think of the animals and their interactions with the world around them let alone other animals.&#x20;

### Plant interactions

The plants will be a vital part of the game and I will find a system that encourages the player to place as many as they would like, in strategically advantageous places so as to help the ecosystem. For example, from Equilinox, a bird makes a nest in a tree to avoid danger, which also acts as its breeding ground and hunting ground. If that tree wasn't there then maybe that bird wouldn't have been able to create its nest, meaning it couldn't have spawned. There will be fruit trees and bushes alongside the normal variety, and these should feed the animals that live in an area around them from a "pool" of food that replenishes over time. This would mean that the pool could not support too many animals, promoting the player to be constantly planting new trees. In this same fashion could be a beaver, which uses trees to build its home, or a little mammal that digs plants up for their roots. These animals all "destroy" the ecosystem to feed themselves and this would mean that if the player didn't support the ecosystem then things would begin to fail- the player would have to stay on top of keeping a balanced system, I will implement a replanting system. If the tree reaches an "age" (defined by a  set amount of in-game days) the tree will be eligible to drop a new seed. This seed can only be placed on fertile soil tiles and will be very susceptible to dangers as it is so small. This will mean a forest will - over time - expand, which could be a problem if it takes up too much food area. This then will loop back into promoting the player to have animals that destroy the trees and plants, to ensure the trees don't spread too quickly.&#x20;

&#x20;This also means the player will be having to pay close attention to what is going on, as I hope to use the difficulty settings to decide on how often to give the player a warning over the status of the ecosystem. For example on easy it will tell the player when they are unbalanced whereas on hard it will only tell the player when they are pretty much dead to something sneaky- possibly a **disease** in certain plants.&#x20;

### Disasters

I will implement an interesting interaction: disasters, a way of ramping up the difficulty whilst keeping it random. I will make it so every in-game day it rolls a chance, if the chance is met then a disaster is selected from a list and implemented into the game. This could range from an earthquake which could knock down trees and bushes, a flood that submerges an area for a time, a drought which does the opposite or a disease, which will kill of a percentage of animals that are within a range of other animals. The disease would be vital for making people spread their creatures and plants over a large area, so as not to be eradicated in one disease. This would be like the difficulty system from "Minecraft", in which the difficulty is taken by a base value selected at the start of the game (this could rely on the [help system](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#help-system) implemented earlier) and then increases over a set in-game time period, to a maximum.

## Limitations

### Limitation 1- Model Design and Perspective

Ideally, I would  implement a 3D system into the game. I feel like this would show off the world the player has created in an even better way, really highlighting the plants and animals. The problem is initially the 3D movement would mean that every model would have to be created in a 3D environment and would have to look good. The camera would have to be able to be rotated on 3 axes, which could allow for clipping bugs and ways of losing the camera. Due to these reasons and the time demand it would take, I feel like just sticking to 2D and putting the focus on the interactions is the key.&#x20;

### Limitation 2- Quantity of fauna and flora

I believe that I am going to have to create a limit on the amount of creatures and plants that can be on the world at any time- I would do this so that the game would have better performance as it will be a browser game, meaning it will have limited capacity. However if I had more time and understanding of game development I would love to release the game and let the player download it and then have total control over what happens, for instance letting them spawn hundreds of one creature.&#x20;

### Limitation 3- The environment

I would like the general environment of the game to be one of education and relaxation. I believe that the game should therefore have a relaxing sound track and audio effects, yet I believe that this may take too long and be too difficult to learn to be efficiently put into the game.&#x20;

I would also like to implement an inspection mechanic, where the player can click on something and have facts about it displayed. This is much more do-able, but it heavily depends on how many things I add, as too many implementations would have me spending more time on writing about animals than improving the game.
