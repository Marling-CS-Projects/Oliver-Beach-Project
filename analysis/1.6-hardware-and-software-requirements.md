# 1.6 Hardware and Software Requirements

## Development Requirements

The development requirements are the requirements to both develop the game and the requirements to run the game. As I want my game to be loaded on the browser, this means the requirements for the user to load a browser.

The development requirements for me to code depend on the requirements of the app I decide to use to code the program.&#x20;

| Github             | Runs on Chrome, so if Chrome runs so does Github                                                                    |
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

I believe both of these environments have the ability to create the code I have envisioned, whilst also featuring libraries and tools built in to assist me in my creation of the game. I may also use Replit at some points however it runs inside of google chrome and other browsers so as with Github I believe that if the browser can run on the computer Replit will also work. This would be useful as it would allow me to code whilst being away from where I have set up my VSC and Github whilst still accessing my saved files for example.&#x20;

## User Requirements

Using the evidence from "Oberlo", I can see the top three browsers in 2023 is: Chrome, Safari and then Edge.&#x20;

I believe I will use Google Chrome. It is clearly the most popular browser, giving me a massive base to advertise my game to. Whilst the game will still need to run on the other browsers (shouldn't be too difficult so long as I don't introduce anything that is unavailable in certain browsers) I will model and design the game on Chrome, so I know everything works inside the browser of my choice.&#x20;
