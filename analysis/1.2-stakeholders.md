# 1.2 Stakeholders

## Customer Role

As mentioned in the prior section of analysis, [1.1](1.1-problem-identification.md), the video game industry is large- there is a lot of money to be made and a lot of people to sell to. This draws a lot of attraction from large companies and businesses, where there is high demand there needs to be high supply.&#x20;



So who is making this market profitable? Where are the customers from, where do they play, how old are they in general- I want to find out about the general demographic of the customers to the gaming marketplace, eventually using this to understand the way game companies monopolise on the market.
