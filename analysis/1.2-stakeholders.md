# 1.2 Stakeholders

## Customer Role&#x20;

As mentioned in the prior section of analysis, [1.1](1.1-problem-identification.md), the video game industry is large- there is a lot of money to be made and a lot of people to sell to. This draws a lot of attraction from large companies and businesses, where there is high demand there needs to be high supply.&#x20;



So who is making this market profitable? Where are the customers from, where do they play, how old are they in general- I want to find out about the general demographic of the customers to the gaming marketplace, eventually using this to understand the way game companies monopolise on the market.

Chart one demonstrates what has already been stated in the [Problem Identification](1.1-problem-identification.md), the gradual and steady increase in the number of people playing video games, with an expected and continual growth.&#x20;
