## Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation

Abstraction is the process of removing unnecessary information from an idea until you are left with just the core concepts, then focussing on the core. This speeds up the work process, allowing the creator to ignore unnecessary information and details and instead creating a system that promotes a time efficient work environment. In my game, this means abstracting the core interactions and ideas from the ideas I have around second stage things, like the visuals or audio areas of the game- focussing solely on the code and what makes the game unique.&#x20;

Visualisation is the idea of seeing how something is going to happen before it happens. This relies on an understanding, in this case, of the code itself and the ecosystems I wish to imitate. I need to be able to visualise the interactions that will happen, the code that is needed to make those interactions occur and the way the player will see both things combined. This visualisation helps the developer save time on having to guess what will happen if they do x thing, as they have already envisioned a solution or a work around. This will save me time and relies on my understanding mainly of the interactions between the things I want to add and then the code that will be needed to bring that to life. As of right now I know the basics of the ecosystem I wish to implement but my weakness is my lack of understanding of how the code will look to make my ideas come true.

## Thinking Ahead

Thinking ahead is vital for coding in any circumstances, but it matters even more in the time constraints of this project. This means that as we have a limited time window, it is more important to not waste time- something thinking ahead is vita for. Rather than having to try out many different solutions and techniques, the developer can think ahead to the impact that change will have and use that to predict whether the addition is beneficial and worth the time demand.&#x20;
