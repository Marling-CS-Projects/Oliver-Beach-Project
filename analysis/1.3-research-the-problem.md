### Overview

Terra Nil is a "reverse city builder" game that allows the player to mend a broken eco system. It uses intricate systems to create a unique game that has the player fix a broken world using technology, before eventually removing said technology and leaving no trace the player was there.&#x20;

### Implementation System

In terra nil, the player has a bar along the base of the screen that allows them to choose what they want to place, spending points that they have earned from completing positive tasks in other areas.&#x20;

### World design and Art style

The game features a simplistic yet visually pleasing art style, one that keeps the player entertained with the little visuals yet doesn't overload at any point. The world is uniquely generate each time, meaning no one strategy will work every time.

| The implementation system | I really like the system with which the player can add items to the map, a crisp looking bar along the bottom of the screen. |
| The art style             | It is very simple, just a colorful and unique design that would be simple to copy from a top down perspective                |

| Unique World Design        | It would take too long to design multiple intricate worlds, and the player will have control of how their game turns out.                                                       |
| The camera rotation system | Whilst you can't see objects from the back, the player can move the camera around and I believe that this would require too much focus on perspective to be good to implement.  |
