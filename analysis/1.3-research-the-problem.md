## Terra Nil

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Overview

Terra Nil is a "reverse city builder" game that allows the player to mend a broken eco system. It uses intricate systems to create a unique game that has the player fix a broken world using technology, before eventually removing said technology and leaving no trace the player was there. The game is won when the player removes all their implementations and leaves behind a clean environment. The player is given a barren wasteland with no signs of life and has to deploy their growth systems to cover a certain area. For example, a field will grow a meadow of flowers when supplied with electricity. This game uses the points the player earns to deploy buildings that can provide what is needed, for example, a solar panel that then allows for an electricity system that will power the deployed buildings, whether this be for a water based system or something for the forests. The player has to be ready to destroy the land to begin the process of rebuilding, setting fire to forests to provide the ground the nutrients needed to regrow. The game focuses on teaching the importance of nature and the way that everything can recover if treated well.&#x20;

### Implementation System

In terra nil, the player has a bar along the base of the screen that allows them to choose what they want to place, spending points that they have earned from completing positive tasks in other areas. This simple bar system creates a stylish and modern look to the game, the player seeing clearly what they can deploy and the requirements behind it with little to no delay. The game really feels smooth to play because of this- the lack of difficulty in seeing what should be done next really enables the player to flow through each stage.

### World design and Art style

The game features a simplistic yet visually pleasing art style, one that keeps the player entertained with the little visuals yet doesn't overload at any point. The world is uniquely generate each time, meaning no one strategy will work every time. The key here in my opinion is the little animations the player is rewarded with each time they do an action, these are what promote a positive reaction from the player and promote future placement of more. The little ripple outwards of water when a pump is deployed and the sound effect played is what the player needs to continue playing and really embrace the game.&#x20;

### Area System

Each deployed machine covers a certain area, displayed with a green area ring. This is vital to the game, as it promotes strategic thinking from the player, causing them to have to think the most efficient route towards their goal, saving the most resources as the game can be failed if the player runs out of points. This means the player has a certain route to follow without being limited to a game plan- each situation elicits a new response from the player, a new reaction that could save the run- or could end it.&#x20;

| The implementation system | I really like the system with which the player can add items to the map, a crisp looking bar along the bottom of the screen.                                                            |
| The art style             | It is very simple, just a colorful and unique design that would be simple to copy from a top down perspective                                                                           |
| A saving feature          | The game features the ability to pause and save the world, I won't be able to go this into depth but I would like to be able to allow the player to save a high score to their storage. |

| Unique World Design        | It would take too long to design multiple intricate worlds, and the player will have control of how their game turns out.                                                       |
| The camera rotation system | Whilst you can't see objects from the back, the player can move the camera around and I believe that this would require too much focus on perspective to be good to implement.  |

## Ecosystem

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Overview

Ecosystem is an ocean ecosystem management and creation game. The player creates an ocean reef, nurturing fish from baby to adult, providing safety and food for all. The game features multiple game modes, from a point based game mode to a freeplay god mode. The game promotes education around the earths underwater ecosystems, as hinted by the name. The game is run with the main goal of promoting a stable, balanced ecosystem that causes growth for all the species involved. The player will find humour in the models of the fish and the random names each time, whilst still learning things based on the predator prey mechanics and the requirements that each fish may have to be spawned or to survive. For example, the player must learn about the codependency between predators and prey by the fact that the predator relies on the prey to survive- if spawned too far away or in too great an imbalance the player will quickly lose their entire stock of one of the two- the other one may not survive too long after that either, breeding out of control and eating more food than can be provided whilst remaining unchecked. The player will witness random evolution and change and will learn the basics of genetic mutation and differentiation.&#x20;

### Implementation System

This game features a similar style to Terra Nil in how new creatures are added, using a bar along the base of the screen and allowing the player to drag and drop wherever they like in the world. The main difference I found was that the player has access to a wide variety of different menus, featuring a terrain builder and landscape manipulator.&#x20;

### World design and the art style

Whilst I love the art style, the game is too realistic for me to duplicate. The art is meant to mimic real life, featuring realistic physics and water interactions, plus uniquely designed fish of both reality and imagination.&#x20;

### Map and Manager

The game features a map that displays the location of the currently implemented species and a manager that shows the quantity of each. This allows the player to see where the majority of a species may hide out, so that they can provide better care for said fish.&#x20;

### The fun aspect

The game can also be played in a less serious manner, playing a game solely to only have herbivores or to create the strangest animal possible. While this may not be the goal of the game, it can be done and can be funny to both watch and play.&#x20;

| The would building | Whilst I beleive it may be too difficult to build in the scale the game lets you, I hope to be able to let the player build rocks for shelter and trees and plants etc.  |
| The feeding system | I like  the idea that the player gets to place down the food and plants the animals eat.                                                                                 |
| The menu taskbar   | I like the taskbar that lets the player know how many and what species they have alive.                                                                                  |
| Job manager        | I like the menu that tells the player what task needs to be completed.                                                                                                   |

| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The mating ground system | A big part of the game is assigning an area for the animals to mate, promoting separation and management. I don't particularly like this idea and would rather have a requirement system |
| The art style            | The art style is too advanced for me to copy in the time frame given, it is designed to be realistic and the interactions I believe would be to difficult to copy                        |

## Equilinox

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (7).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Overview

A simple world manager game, where the player gets to choose where pretty much everything goes. Every animal and plant has its own life, requirements, and behavior so you need to ensure that each species is satisfied with its environment. The ecosystems must be balanced to enable everything to survive- an unbalanced eco system will not survive long. Healthy, happy animals will live longer, breed more and earn more points for the player. The player gets to enjoy a vibrant world through multiple seasons, seeing the development of a world of their dreams. Creatures are interactive, roaming about and interacting with one another. The player will feel regret as they lose an animal to old age or regret implementing a new species as it decimates an older species. However, this regret will be quickly forgotten upon seeing the effect those deaths had on the environment, nurturing the land and allowing the regrowth of a certain species of plant that had been eaten to near extinction, and if the player really did make a mistake, then the next game they play will be started with the new knowledge that they have gathered, a better way of dealing with that situation. Any player can figure their way through the game, not searching something and just learning from prior experience.&#x20;

### Implementation system

Different to the other games, Equilinox features a large menu that the player opens to choose from a list of plants or animals. This expansive list lets the player select whatever it is they would like to plant or place, and then place wherever they want costing points. It is more like a shop, where the player purchases new things to implement into their word.&#x20;

### World design and art style

From everything I have seen, the world design stays the same for each player, featuring its uniqueness in the absolute control given to the player. It also features a season and environment system, allowing the player to explore a winter world, a swamp or the starter hill and lake. The art style may be my favorite of any of these games, a lovely low poly system that really gets across what each and every animal and plant is whilst still being unique and individual.&#x20;

| The art style   | This art style is my favorite of any of the games I have looked at. From my art GCSE I believe I can duplicate the low poly style relatively easily in either 2d or 3d, allowing me lots of variety and choice.                     |
| The date system | I really like the feature that allows the player to see how many days they have put into the world, showing how long they have kept the ecosystem alive. This would also tie into my system to make the game harder as it goes on.  |
| Tasks system    | I really like the task system, that allows the player to earn little rewards from completing certain tasks, for instance I believe a reward of one tier 3 animal could given if 10 happy tier 2 animals are alive at that point.    |

| The variety        | This game just has too much in terms of variety for the player, the menu features hundreds of different choices and that is too much for me to make.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| The feeding system | The level of design is too deep for me to copy completely, with plants having growth phases and animals growing from babies to adults. I plan on having an age system which ends at mating maturity but not a developing age visual as this would make a complicated system featuring lots of new required inputs of visuals.  |
