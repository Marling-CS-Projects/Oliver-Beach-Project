<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Overview

Terra Nil is a "reverse city builder" game that allows the player to mend a broken eco system. It uses intricate systems to create a unique game that has the player fix a broken world using technology, before eventually removing said technology and leaving no trace the player was there.&#x20;

### Implementation System

In terra nil, the player has a bar along the base of the screen that allows them to choose what they want to place, spending points that they have earned from completing positive tasks in other areas.&#x20;

### World design and Art style

The game features a simplistic yet visually pleasing art style, one that keeps the player entertained with the little visuals yet doesn't overload at any point. The world is uniquely generate each time, meaning no one strategy will work every time.

| Feature                   | Justification                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The implementation system | I really like the system with which the player can add items to the map, a crisp looking bar along the bottom of the screen.                                                            |
| The art style             | It is very simple, just a colorful and unique design that would be simple to copy from a top down perspective                                                                           |
| A saving feature          | The game features the ability to pause and save the world, I won't be able to go this into depth but I would like to be able to allow the player to save a high score to their storage. |

| Feature                    | Justification                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unique World Design        | It would take too long to design multiple intricate worlds, and the player will have control of how their game turns out.                                                       |
| The camera rotation system | Whilst you can't see objects from the back, the player can move the camera around and I believe that this would require too much focus on perspective to be good to implement.  |

## Ecosystem

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (7).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Overview

Ecosystem is an ocean ecosystem management and creation game. The player creates an ocean reef, nurturing fish from baby to adult, providing safety and food for all. The game features multiple game modes, from a point based game mode to a freeplay god mode.&#x20;

### Implementation System

This game features a similiar style to Terra Nil in how new creatures are added, using a bar along the base of the screen and allowing the player to drag and drop wherever they like in the world. The main difference I found was that the player has access to a wide variety of different menues, featuring a terrain builder and landscape manipulator.&#x20;

### World design and the art style

Whilst I love the art style, the game is too realistic for me to duplicate. The art is meant to mimic real life, featuring realistic physics and water interactions, plus uniquely designed fish of both reality and imagination.&#x20;

| Feature            | Justification                                                                                                                                                            |

| The would building | Whilst I beleive it may be too difficult to build in the scale the game lets you, I hope to be able to let the player build rocks for shelter and trees and plants etc.  |
| The feeding system | I like  the idea that the player gets to place down the food and plants the animals eat.                                                                                 |
| The menu taskbar   | I like the taskbar that lets the player know how many and what species they have alive.                                                                                  |
| Job manager        | I like the menu that tells the player what task needs to be completed.                                                                                                   |

| Feature                  | Justification                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The mating ground system | A big part of the game is assigning an area for the animals to mate, promoting separation and management. I don't particularly like this idea and would rather have a requirement system |
| The art style            | The art style is too advanced for me to copy in the time frame given, it is designed to be realistic and the interactions I believe would be to difficult to copy                        |

## Equilinox

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Overview

A simple world manager game, where the player gets to choose where pretty much everything goes. Every animal and plant has its own life, requirements, and behavior so you need to ensure that each species is satisfied with its environment. The ecosystems must be balanced to enable everything to survive- an unbalanced eco system will not survive long. Healthy, happy animals will live longer, breed more and earn more points for the player.&#x20;

### Implementation system

Different to the other games, Equilinox features a large menu that the player opens to choose from a list of plants or animals. This expansive list lets the player select whatever it is they would like to plant or place, and then place wherever they want costing points. It is more like a shop, where the player purchases new things to implement into their word.&#x20;

### World design and art style

From everything I have seen, the world design stays the same for each player, featuring its uniqueness in the absolute control given to the player.&#x20;
