This is important as it makes the game a little more realistic and helps the immersion. </td><td><a href="../analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#animal-interactions">Animal interactions</a></td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Collisions</td><td>Building off this, it will be less so the different animals that need to interact and more so the player and the point system and possibly a "hunter" enemy. </td><td><a href="../analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#animal-interactions">Animal interactions</a></td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Controls</td><td>The controls will be a simple WASD to move the camera, mouse to click and place and Q or E to rotate.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Controls</td><td>Again building off my original idea, instead of WASD to move the camera it should move the player character, with Q and E no longer being necessary. </td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 2         | A low poly design for each thing implemented, either world plant or animal. Low poly means that it will have a low polygon count, implying simple textures and shapes.  | Which cycle?         |
