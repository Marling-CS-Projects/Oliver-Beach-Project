## Criteria

### Criterion 1: Implementing- Failure

Criterion 1 would be a fail, as I did not implement it at all. The idea of "implementing something" came from my original game idea, which was no longer necessary in the new game. From my success criteria, I originally wanted to have a bar along the bottom of the screen, which would let the player see what they could add into the world. In the new game this wasn't necessary so I didn't add it, meaning this success criteria wasn't implemented, resulting in a fail. I believe that adding this system would have limited me either way. Something I had forgotten to consider is how intensive a large menu system with many options could be on the browser, making it seem not fluid as every time the player clicked one they had to wait for it to load and redirect them.&#x20;

I believe that if I could go back and look through my project again, I would not implement this feature. I believe that it has little to no place in my current game and would have been a waste of time to remake in the new games language and implementing it appropriately, so I am pleased that I didn't implement this. This also applies to the future, I do not believe that this has a place in the current game and I don't see where it would be needed in future.&#x20;

### Criterion 2: Model Design- Pass

I believe that criterion 2 was a partial pass compared with the success criteria but a complete pass in my game. Compared with the success criteria I have it as only a partial pass as the original goal was to have a low poly design for the animals and the plants. In my actual game there are no plants so my original idea can not be fully added. However, in my game the animals and treat that are present did recieve a low poly character design with a simple, clear colour scheme. I believe that this shows that I completed the success criteria in my game. Due to the simple nature of the design I believe it is very friendly to the future limitations of browsers, meaning I doubt it will ever not be able to load due to the way I saved resources whilst coding.&#x20;

Despite me giving this section a pass, I do wish that I had given the hunter a more detailed character design, rather than the orb. On the other hand, implementing a more detailed hunter would have required a system where the character could rotate to "point and face" the player as they moved (so  the "mouth" would be the point of collision), which would have been tough to implement and could have messed with the hitbox, so I don't believe that it was a necessary change, just one that would have been aesthetically pleasing. Depending on the quality I produced, it could also have been a scary image to a younger child, which would have violated the guidelines for the [PEGI system](../analysis/1.2-stakeholders.md#pegi), which was a large goal of mine. Overall because of these two negatives versus the one positive, I do not believe in future I would add a new model to the hunter.&#x20;

### Criterion 3
