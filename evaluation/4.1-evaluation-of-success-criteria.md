## Criteria

### Criterion 1: Implementing- Failure

Criterion 1 would be a fail, as I did not implement it at all. The idea of "implementing something" came from my original game idea, which was no longer necessary in the new game. From my success criteria, I originally wanted to have a bar along the bottom of the screen, which would let the player see what they could add into the world. In the new game this wasn't necessary so I didn't add it, meaning this success criteria wasn't implemented, resulting in a fail. I believe that adding this system would have limited me either way. Something I had forgotten to consider is how intensive a large menu system with many options could be on the browser, making it seem not fluid as every time the player clicked one they had to wait for it to load and redirect them.&#x20;

I believe that if I could go back and look through my project again, I would not implement this feature. I believe that it has little to no place in my current game and would have been a waste of time to remake in the new games language and implementing it appropriately, so I am pleased that I didn't implement this. This also applies to the future, I do not believe that this has a place in the current game and I don't see where it would be needed in future.&#x20;

### Criterion 2: Model Design- Pass

I believe that criterion 2 was a partial pass compared with the success criteria but a complete pass in my game. Compared with the success criteria I have it as only a partial pass as the original goal was to have a low poly design for the animals and the plants. In my actual game there are no plants so my original idea can not be fully added. However, in my game the animals and treat that are present did recieve a low poly character design with a simple, clear colour scheme. I believe that this shows that I completed the success criteria in my game. Due to the simple nature of the design I believe it is very friendly to the future limitations of browsers, meaning I doubt it will ever not be able to load due to the way I saved resources whilst coding.&#x20;

Despite me giving this section a pass, I do wish that I had given the hunter a more detailed character design, rather than the orb. On the other hand, implementing a more detailed hunter would have required a system where the character could rotate to "point and face" the player as they moved (so  the "mouth" would be the point of collision), which would have been tough to implement and could have messed with the hitbox, so I don't believe that it was a necessary change, just one that would have been aesthetically pleasing. Depending on the quality I produced, it could also have been a scary image to a younger child, which would have violated the guidelines for the [PEGI system](../analysis/1.2-stakeholders.md#pegi), which was a large goal of mine. Overall because of these two negatives versus the one positive, I do not believe in future I would add a new model to the hunter.&#x20;

### Criterion 3: Interactions (world)- Partial Pass

From the success criteria, the most important aspects are that: "sustain the actions of the eco system on its own" and "changing the world design with some actions made by both the player and the machine." The first part is the reason it is only a partial pass, as I did not implement a system for the eco system, so there was nothing for the computer or player to sustain, meaning that it is a fail as it was not added. The second part is, I believe, the more important of the two areas. The game should be able to handle changes to the world, on both the computers side and the players side. This was implemented slightly, with the player being able to pick up and orb and move around the "world" whilst the game smoothly handles both these aspects, whilst also making the hunter follow the player. The eco-system sustainance would not be added in future as it is not an aspect of the game that I want to add or feel is necessary and from my [testing ](../testing/3.2-usability-testing.md)people weren't asking for more non-player interactions, as would have been the case with an eco-system.&#x20;

However, I do wish that I had given the game something more to handle as a background process, which would have made the world more interesting to play in and look at. Something like a kelp tree that would move slowly around or a rock or bush at the bottom of the screen could have been aesthetically pleasing, so I am sad that I didn't have the knowledge at the time of world design to add something like this. I believe if I implemented it properly it wouldn't have even interfered with  the limitations of the browser, as it would be a small little background piece.&#x20;

### Criterion 4: Interactions (Player)- Pass

I believe this was a complete pass as the game does smoothly handle the players interactions inside the game. Any movement key pressed causes a response with little to no delay, something that I learnt was vital for players experience inside my [research](../analysis/1.3-research-the-problem.md).&#x20;

The only thing that I am displeased with in this section is the way the hitbox of the players character sometimes does not interact correctly with both the fast orange orb and the hunter. This can cause annoyance and would be something I would want to change in future, however it is a small issue that does not affect the player enough for it to cause this section to not pass.&#x20;

### Criterion 5: Camera- Pass

The camera is a complete success. [Camera System](../analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#camera-system) taught me that the game should have a simple system that allows the camera to not get stuck and to move with the WASD keys. Whilst this is not how I ended up implementing the camera, I believe the idea was implemented closely enough to my success criterias goal that it is a pass. The camera system is one of the few that I believe I would change nothing about the system. The camera clearly displays what the player is doing. It stays focussed due to it just displaying the webpage as per usual, meaning the player misses nothing. Due to the lack of movement there is zero lag or delay, meaning the limitations are small or non existent so I believe the camera is a main factor that helps the game be available on even the worse devices. As you can see from the images, no matter the location of the player the game stays focussed and simple thanks to the camera.&#x20;

### Criterion 6: World design- Pass

The game easily passes the world design as the success criteria I created for it was simple and easy. The game is easy on the eye by being so open and empty, allowing clear distinction of where the player is versus where the enemy and the food are. The colours chose are easy to see against the background. This section easily passes and follows the guide from my [World design](../analysis/1.3-research-the-problem.md#world-design-and-art-style), meaning it is in my opinion an easy pass.&#x20;

However, as I stated in one of the previous criteria, I do feel like it is almost too easy. I wish I had added a kelp forest somewhere and some other form of background filler.&#x20;
