# 4.2 Evaluation of Usability Features

## Effective



| Feature No. | Description                                      | Success/Fail    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| 1           | Can you easily see what the goal of the game is? | Success         |
| 2           | Can you see where you are supposed to go?        | Partial Success |
| 3           | What you are supposed to do?                     | Success         |

### Feature 1

From testing, I have a result of 72% of players knowing what to do whilst playing the game. This implies that some players didn't know how they were supposed to play. This is where an information page and menu system with a help page could have helped, but even without it a very large quantity of people knew what to do, indicating a pass.&#x20;

### Feature 2

Some players couldn't immediately see where they were supposed to move and this was an issue I found from my very first tests, so I added to see if others suffered the same problem. I was relying on the bright colours to lead the player to what to gain and what to avoid. This time though, 63% of people who played my game knew where to go. This indicates to me that this section needs work, possibly an indicator as to where to move to or what to gain / what to avoid.&#x20;

### Feature 3

This was a very solid pass. 90% of players realised what they were supposed to do in the game, again indicating my world and character design was good enough to create a fun game. I used my research into video games to learn what colours inticed which emotion / feeling and used this to colour the characters against the background and I am glad that this research worked.&#x20;

## Efficient



| Feature No. | Description                                                              | Success/Fail    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| 1           | Are the controls self explanatory?                                       | Partial Success |
| 2           | Did you have any difficulty moving in the game?                          | Partial Success |
| 3           | Was it self explanatory what to do when you died / wanted to play again? | Pass            |

### Feature 1

A total 63% of players indicated that they found it very easy to understand the controls, with the remaining 37% finding it easy. This indicates to me that whilst the controls are self explanatory (due to me using the most common WASD controls and also allowing the arrow keys as is common on browser games) there could have been an indication on what to press to do what, or a comment on how there were no extra controls. For example, some users may have pressed another button ie Q or E to use an ability and found nothing happened.&#x20;

### Feature 2

A large quantity of 72% of players found that they had no difficulty moving. Due to this I believe it passed, however, 9% of players had some difficulty whilst the rest had a little difficulty. This indicates to me that in my game, some movement was not explained well or that some system was incorrect here. I can imagine it to do with the hitbox and registration of collisions or the diagonal movement being an issue, but either way I believe the game still allows the player to operate the character and move it around, indicating a partial success in my opinion.&#x20;

### Feature 3

Feature 3 was one I put a lot of time into re doing, as I was dissatisfied with my initial products whereas my final piece came out significantly better. I am glad I did this as from my testing results 91% of players knew what to do when they died. This indicated the game over screen clearly signified that they had lost / died and the new game button was very clear and obvious in what it did. Because of these results I have given the game a clear success: Even those not well versed in games knew what to do when they died, indicating it also follows my accessibility goals.&#x20;

## Engaging

| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Was the game fun?                                                         | Success      |
| 2           | Would you play it again?                                                  | Success      |
| 3           | Do you feel like you would want to beat your own score or someone else's? | Success      |
| 4           | Did you like the simple art and the colour scheme?                        | Success      |

### Feature 1

A blunt question but one that I hoped would get simple answers to help me gather whether the overall game had succeeded in being what it was, a game. To my delight, 82% said that yes they found it fun, one saying somewhat and one saying no. This exceeds my expectations as the game was simple and something I feared was it being un-fun as it could grow boring, but from verbal feedback, I gathered that the difficulty was placed well enough that the challenge gave a solid sense of victory when beaten yet left the players still playing more to beat their previous high score. This leaves this feature as a clear success, exceeding my expectations of the game.&#x20;

### Feature 2 + 3

Whether the player would play again was important as my game was very focussed on a high score, which only works if the player tries to better their high score. The game doesn't have much else as a reward system other than the satisfaction to seeing that score increase. Because of this, a total 91% saying they would play again at some point with 72% saying they definitely would play again is excellent. This shows me this section is worth the pass and success, as so many would want to play again. On the other hand, in future I would definitely consider adding a leaderboard and a change to the game when certain scores were met as a reward.&#x20;

Very similiarly is feature 3, in which I asked players if they would want to beat either their own score or a friends score upon playing the game again, to which my testers gave me precisely the same percentage values as given in the prior question. Due to this, I give this section a pass as well.&#x20;

### Feature 4

I am overwhelmingly pleased with this result. A total 91% of players did like the simple aesthetic of the game, which is useful as the simple aesthetic not only allows for a simpler game but also a higher reolution and game speed due to less visual clutter on screen. All of these ideas come together to create the very simple visuals I produced, which then garnered the support they did. Overall I give this section a success due to this, and I account many of the non functional success of the game to this section.&#x20;

## Error Tolerant

| 2           | Did anything game breaking happen?                                                                                                     |                |
| 3           | <p>Was there any points where the game was un smooth / choppy? <br>If there was a problem how badly did it affect your experience?</p> |                |

### Feature 1

An important non functional aspect of this is that the users game runs smoothly and without crashing. Whilst creating the game any time there was delay on inputs or in the game displaying something it became very visible to the player and made the game become tiring and boring quickly, as the player got frustrated to dying to a game freeze or a collision not counting and suddenly the orange orb is far away from the player. However, thanks to my low intensity of game design colours and visual clutter, the game remains at a high fps count with little to no stutters and I have never seen the game crash before. Due to this, it achieves what I would want from success criteria, giving it a success.
