# 4.2 Evaluation of Usability Features

## Effective



| Feature No. | Description                                      | Success/Fail    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| 1           | Can you easily see what the goal of the game is? | Success         |
| 2           | Can you see where you are supposed to go?        | Partial Success |
| 3           | What you are supposed to do?                     | Success         |

### Feature 1

From testing, I have a result of 72% of players knowing what to do whilst playing the game. This implies that some players didn't know how they were supposed to play. This is where an information page and menu system with a help page could have helped, but even without it a very large quantity of people knew what to do, indicating a pass.&#x20;

### Feature 2

Some players couldn't immediately see where they were supposed to move and this was an issue I found from my very first tests, so I added to see if others suffered the same problem. I was relying on the bright colours to lead the player to what to gain and what to avoid. This time though, 63% of people who played my game knew where to go. This indicates to me that this section needs work, possibly an indicator as to where to move to or what to gain / what to avoid.&#x20;

### Feature 3

This was a very solid pass. 90% of players realised what they were supposed to do in the game, again indicating my world and character design was good enough to create a fun game. I used my research into video games to learn what colours inticed which emotion / feeling and used this to colour the characters against the background and I am glad that this research worked.&#x20;

| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| 1           | Are the controls self explanatory?                                        | Partial Success |
| 2           | Did you have any difficulty moving in the game?                           | Partial Success |
| 3           |  Was it self explanatory what to do when you died / wanted to play again? |                 |

### Feature 1

A total 63% of players indicated that they found it very easy to understand the controls, with the remaining 37% finding it easy. This indicates to me that whilst the controls are self explanatory (due to me using the most common WASD controls and also allowing the arrow keys as is common on browser games) there could have been an indication on what to press to do what, or a comment on how there were no extra controls. For example, some users may have pressed another button ie Q or E to use an ability and found nothing happened.&#x20;

### Feature 2

A large quantity of 72% of players found that they had no difficulty moving. Due to this I believe it passed, however, 9% of players had some difficulty whilst the rest had a little difficulty. This indicates to me that in my game, some movement was not explained well or that some system was incorrect here. I can imagine it to do with the hitbox and registration of collisions or the diagonal movement being an issue, but either way I believe the game still allows the player to operate the character and move it around, indicating a partial pass in my opinion.&#x20;
