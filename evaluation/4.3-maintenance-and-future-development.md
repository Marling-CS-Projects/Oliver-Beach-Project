# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

## Current Limitations of Project

* **Death Loop -->** If the player dies in the centre they will repeatedly die, getting stuck in a loop. The only way to escape this is to move the second the game starts which is rather difficult for most players. Occasionaly the player can die in the same pixels the hunter spawns on in which case the only way to escape the loop is by restarting the game by reloading the webpage which ruins the immersion.&#x20;
* **Interactions with the World -->** Some system that the computer would handle in the background to flesh the game out and fill the screen more could be useful. This could have been done with some form of kelp forest or moving fish that were not under the players control.&#x20;

## Future Development

### Short Term Bug Fixes

**Death Loop -->** This should be a smaller fix. I would need to reset the position of the fish during the game over screen to an x y coordinates that correlate to the starting position.&#x20;

### Long Term Addressing Limitations
