# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

## Current Limitations of Project

* **Death Loop -->** If the player dies in the centre they will repeatedly die, getting stuck in a loop. The only way to escape this is to move the second the game starts which is rather difficult for most players. Occasionaly the player can die in the same pixels the hunter spawns on in which case the only way to escape the loop is by restarting the game by reloading the webpage which ruins the immersion.&#x20;
* **Interactions with the World -->** Some system that the computer would handle in the background to flesh the game out and fill the screen more could be useful. This could have been done with some form of kelp forest or moving fish that were not under the players control.&#x20;
* **Save System + Help System -->** This was something that I would of learnt and implemented had I had enough time to do so and also had the knowledge. A basic system of saving that let the player score their all time high score and a help system that would have let them see little tips when they started playing.&#x20;
* **List of characters -->** Whilst initially designed for my original code, a list of characters would still help the modern game. I beleive that a brief description of each character in a seperate location opened by a button would have been easy to add and would have added some connection to the figures whilst also showing a new player which to avoid / which to pickup, especially helpful for the younger player.&#x20;
* **Browser based -->** If I wanted to expand the game more, I feel that making it a download would be the best option. The game on browser is limited in size and functionality whereas on a download the game could be spread further through distribution methods and I would have more room to expand the game.&#x20;

## Future Development

### Short Term Bug Fixes

**Death Loop -->** This should be a smaller fix. I would need to reset the position of the fish during the game over screen to an x y coordinates that correlate to the starting position.&#x20;

**List of characters -->** This would have been a brief little fix as I would have created the menu screen I had been thinking about for a long period. One of the buttons in the menu would have created a new background to overlay the rest of the screen, displaying text on this screen and a little image of each of the characters.&#x20;

### Long Term Addressing Limitations

**Interactions with the World -->** This would have taken a long time to implement as I would have had to learn a more detailed character modelling system, whilst then learning figure rigging to make it move organically, whilst also staying inside my low requirements goal.&#x20;

**Save System + Help System -->** This is a long term fix as to create a save system would have required a completely new system that I had never experienced before, including frontend and backend development and account creation and saving on a web service. This would have severely taken from the time I could commit elsewhere and therefore I feel I made the correct choice in not adding it.&#x20;

**Browser based -->** This is a long term fix as it would require a complete overall of the system, as the coding system (p5.js) is not native to code. Because of this, I would have either had to re-code the p5 libraries as my own or re code the entire project into javascript so that the files could be distributed independently of a browser.&#x20;
