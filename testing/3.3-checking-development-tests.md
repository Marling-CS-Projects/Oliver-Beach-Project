# 3.3 Checking Development Tests

A complete set of tests should be run to assess the final solution.

They could be plucked from the tests in your dev cycles, or be new tests that run the system as a whole.

I will be starting with cycle 3 as the previous two cycles covered a game that I discontinued to change to the new idea that became my final game.&#x20;

## Cycle 3

| Test | Instructions                  | What I expect                                                           | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run code                      | Dot appears with no trail                                               | Fail      |
| 2    | Run revised code              | Dot appears with no trail                                               | Pass      |
| 3    | Run model change code         | Instead of a dot there should be a fish                                 | Fail      |
| 4    | Run model change code revised | Instead of a dot there should be a fish                                 | Pass      |
| 5    | Run background changed code   | Instead of a black background there should be a light blue background.  | Pass      |
