# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

| Test               | Test Details                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | Can you easily see what the goal of the game is? Can you see where you are supposed to go? What you are supposed to do?                                                                                             |
| 2 - Efficient      | Are the controls self explanatory? Did you have any difficulty moving in the game? Was it self explanatory what to do when you died / wanted to play again?                                                         |
| 3 - Engaging       | Was the game fun? Would you play it again? Do you feel like you would want to beat your own score or someone else's? Did you like the simple art and the colour scheme?                                             |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Did you encounter any problems / errors when playing? Did anything game braking happen? Was there any points where the game was un smooth / choppy? If there was a problem how badly did it affect your experience? |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Was the game simple to pick up for the first time? Do you feel like you needed a guide or was it okay without? Do you feel that the game was running too quickly or getting too difficult too quickly?              |

Listed below are the results to the questions. I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation

### User Feedback

### Effective:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (16).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

I am very happy with how this came out, the majority of people giving it a perfect rating. This shows me that I did a good job with the colours used to indicate the "target" and the "enemy".&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This question is similiar to the first, however I realised that some people may not have understood the intention of the game as it starts so quickly. I am very happy that so many people understood the goal initially as I believe that if anyone had put not clear then I would have had to change it because that implies they couldn't even get started with the game.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This question was intended to sum up the prior two. I am happy with the overall result of 90% of people knowing what they are supposed to do.

### Efficient:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This indicates to me that all the players figured out the controls and how to move to and fro in the game, some finding it easier than others.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

It is good to know that some people had difficulty moving. I have to imagine that because they did not have lots of difficulty that the game was still playable and that the character still moved, just the way it moved or the way that it interacted with its surroundings was a little wrong.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

I am very pleased that the majority of people knew what to do when they died. It makes it feel like the changes I made to the death screen were worth it.&#x20;

### Engaging:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Aside from the one person that didn't find it fun, I am pleased that so many enjoyed the game despite its simplicity

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Again, aside from the one person, I am pleased that so many people felt the game had a replay ability feature as I wanted initially.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

I am again very pleased with this result due to the way that the majority agreed they would like to beat a score higher than their own, showing that a sense of challenge and difficulty exists in the game, which could promote replay ability.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (7).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Again, beside the one person I am overwhelmingly pleased with this result. The simple aesthetic not only allows for a simpler game but also a higher reolution and game speed due to less visual clutter on screen.&#x20;

### Error Tolerant:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This was suprising as I had thought I had covered the majority of issues, so to see two errors was impressive. I am glad I checked for this in testing.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The first error is beyond an extreme, however I should still have prepared the game for such extremes and given it some form of if over x score, do y thing (i.e. shut down game, display you win)

The second error may seem to be a joke error however it is a genuine problem, the hitbox of the fish is not mapped to its character model so it can seem that some collisions aren't registered when they should have countered.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (10).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Bar my mis-spelling of breaking, only one person had something truly bad occur, which implies the game survived 90% of players of my small sample size of people trying to break it, something I am very happy with.&#x20;

The one person who did have a game breaking issue reported that the spelling was incorrect in the question, but more importantly that the fish sometimes didnt pick up orbs it should have, again due to the hitbox.&#x20;

### Easy to Learn:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This is a very good result, with 1 being very easy to pick up and 5 being very tough. This implies that 90% of people had an easy time playing the game for the first time and therefore this implies they were able to enjoy the game on the first time, also that it would be easy and accessible to the majority of people, something vital if I am going to try and give the game to younger people.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (12).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This is a better result than I expected, as I thought much more people would say they wished there was some form of guide. Instead the majority were okay with just figuring everything out themselves, something not too difficult due to the simple game.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (17).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This was my least positive question, something I ws fully expecting but was hoping to avoid. Due to the way I coded the difficulty increase, it can reach points where it appears to be increasing exponentially rather than linearly, which whilst making the game in my opinion more fun faster, it also can make the game far too tough for a new player too quickly. I would remedy this by going back over the maths of the point system and finding a way to cap the increase in game speed.&#x20;

## Usability Requirements in Success Criteria

Some of the success criteria requirements fall into the section of usability. These will also be tested now and are listed below:

<table><thead><tr><th width="108">Ref. No.</th><th width="134">Criterion</th><th width="270">Justification</th><th>Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>9</td><td>Performance</td><td>The game needs to run smoothly to give an enjoyable experience, at roughly 30 fps to ensure a smooth experience. </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td><del>PEGI</del></td><td><del>The game will be at maximum a PEGI 7, due to the animals dying. Nothing too graphic. This will mean my game is available to most.</del> </td><td><a href="../analysis/1.2-stakeholders.md#pegi">PEGI</a></td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>PEGI</td><td>The game will be a PEGI rating of 3, with there being no violence and the game just ending when collision occurs, rather than there being anything visible.</td><td><a href="../analysis/1.2-stakeholders.md#pegi">PEGI</a></td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Save system</td><td>A system to save the game and score. Enables better replay ability. Allows players to play the game whenever they want at a leisurely pace. </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Point system</td><td>A system to earn points in the game and save it after, creates a sense of competition. Also makes it possible for competition between friends or possibly online. </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Doesn't crash</td><td>The game runs smoothly and doesn't crash easily, meaning the player doesn't have to worry about being interrupted or losing progress. </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>Help system</td><td>A simple help system to give hints and tips to the player based on what they are doing.</td><td><a href="../analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#help-system">Help</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Criterion 9: Performance

The game does run at a smooth rate. I can not see an exact value on school computers but on both school and my home system the game runs smoothly with little to no glitches / delays. I am very happy with this and believe it passes my success criteria completely.&#x20;

### Criterion 10: PEGI

I believe the game would pass a PEGI rating for my goal, a 3. According to the Northfield St Nicholas Primary School and other such websites, a PEGI 3 should "Should not contain any sounds or pictures that are likely to frighten young children. A very mild form of violence (in a comical context or a childlike setting) is acceptable. No bad language should be heard." My game could only possibly impede on the comical violence and that is when a collision happens between the player and the hunter, when the game flashes to a black screen, but I believe it isnt scary, just a change. Because of this I do believe it counts as playable for any age, so my criterion is passed.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (18).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

It would appear most people that played my game would agree that the PEGI rating I was going for was achieved.&#x20;

### Criterion 11: Save system

This is something I did not add, so it must be counted as a fail. I would have liked to have implemented this however I felt that it was not as neccessary as getting the rest of the game done took priority. For example, whilst it would be nice to be able to keep a score for the player to see how they have improved and what their best is, it would require either a server to store the information and a sign in / account system which I do not know how to make, or a save to the users computer which could take up space and on the low end devices my game is meant to run well on, this could cause a problem.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (19).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This is the point I wish I had been able to add easily, as it is good to see how many people do wish that there was a save system. At the same time, it is nice to see how many people were okay without the system. The peoples reasons for their answers were:&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (20).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

As you can see, the majority of people agree that the main bemefit of the save system would be a highscore saving system, or too preserve a run if someone were playing over a long period of time.&#x20;

### Criterion 12: Point system

This was added to the game, and I am very happy with how it came out. The game now has a visible reason to play that is addictive and maintains entertainment. It does not save the score but I prefer it working like this, allowing the player to have a fresh start and game every time that they die.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (21).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This was a very positive response, with the large majority liking the point system showing I made it correctly, which I am pleased about as it is such a large part of the game.&#x20;

### Criterion 13: Doesn't crash

The game has never crashed on me once I finished coding it. The game loads well in the right resolution for the screen. The closest the game will come to crashing is the massive input delay when the player loads the game on a resolution that is significantly larger than a default. This is a rare case and even then, the game doesn't crash but instead is slow.&#x20;

### Criterion 14: Help system

This is the criterion I am most annoyed that I did not add to the game, as I feel it adds a large ammount of interaction and assistance without being too tough to create. On the other hand, I do not believe the game misses it. The game is pretty simple overall, tips to the player would have been a possible irratation to better players after their first game or two, when they had realised what they are meants to do overall and what to avoid. However I still feel like one or two little help systems could have helped make the game feel more inclusive.&#x20;
