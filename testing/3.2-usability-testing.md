## Criteria To Assess

| Test               | Test Details                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | Can you easily see what the goal of the game is? Can you see where you are supposed to go? What you are supposed to do?                                                                                             |
| 2 - Efficient      | Are the controls self explanatory? Did you have any difficulty moving in the game? Was it self explanatory what to do when you died / wanted to play again?                                                         |
| 3 - Engaging       | Was the game fun? Would you play it again? Do you feel like you would want to beat your own score or someone else's? Did you like the simple art and the colour scheme?                                             |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Did you encounter any problems / errors when playing? Did anything game braking happen? Was there any points where the game was un smooth / choppy? If there was a problem how badly did it affect your experience? |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Was the game simple to pick up for the first time? Do you feel like you needed a guide or was it okay without? Do you feel that the game was running too quickly or getting too difficult too quickly?              |

Listed below are the results to the questions. I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation

### User Feedback

### Effective:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (16).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

I am very happy with how this came out, the majority of people giving it a perfect rating. This shows me that I did a good job with the colours used to indicate the "target" and the "enemy".&#x20;

This question is similiar to the first, however I realised that some people may not have understood the intention of the game as it starts so quickly. I am very happy that so many people understood the goal initially as I believe that if anyone had put not clear then I would have had to change it because that implies they couldn't even get started with the game.&#x20;

This question was intended to sum up the prior two. I am happy with the overall result of 90% of people knowing what they are supposed to do.





## Usability Requirements in Success Criteria

Some of the success criteria requirements fall into the section of usability. These will also be tested now and are listed below:

<table><thead><tr><th width="108">Ref. No.</th><th width="134">Criterion</th><th width="270">Justification</th><th>Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>9</td><td>Performance</td><td>The game needs to run smoothly to give an enjoyable experience, at roughly 30 fps to ensure a smooth experience. </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td><del>PEGI</del></td><td><del>The game will be at maximum a PEGI 7, due to the animals dying. Nothing too graphic. This will mean my game is available to most.</del> </td><td><a href="../analysis/1.2-stakeholders.md#pegi">PEGI</a></td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>PEGI</td><td>The game will be a PEGI rating of 3, with there being no violence and the game just ending when collision occurs, rather than there being anything visible.</td><td><a href="../analysis/1.2-stakeholders.md#pegi">PEGI</a></td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Save system</td><td>A system to save the game and score. Enables better replay ability. Allows players to play the game whenever they want at a leisurely pace. </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Point system</td><td>A system to earn points in the game and save it after, creates a sense of competition. Also makes it possible for competition between friends or possibly online. </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Doesn't crash</td><td>The game runs smoothly and doesn't crash easily, meaning the player doesn't have to worry about being interrupted or losing progress. </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>Help system</td><td>A simple help system to give hints and tips to the player based on what they are doing.</td><td><a href="../analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#help-system">Help</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Criterion 9: Performance

The game does run at a smooth rate. I can not see an exact value on school computers but on both school and my home system the game runs smoothly with little to no glitches / delays. I am very happy with this and believe it passes my success criteria completely.&#x20;

### Criterion 10: PEGI

I believe the game would pass a PEGI rating for my goal, a 3. According to the Northfield St Nicholas Primary School and other such websites, a PEGI 3 should "Should not contain any sounds or pictures that are likely to frighten young children. A very mild form of violence (in a comical context or a childlike setting) is acceptable. No bad language should be heard." My game could only possibly impede on the comical violence and that is when a collision happens between the player and the hunter, when the game flashes to a black screen, but I believe it isnt scary, just a change. Because of this I do believe it counts as playable for any age, so my criterion is passed.&#x20;

### Criterion 11: Save system

This is something I did not add, so it must be counted as a fail. I would have liked to have implemented this however I felt that it was not as neccessary as getting the rest of the game done took priority. For example, whilst it would be nice to be able to keep a score for the player to see how they have improved and what their best is, it would require either a server to store the information and a sign in / account system which I do not know how to make, or a save to the users computer which could take up space and on the low end devices my game is meant to run well on, this could cause a problem.&#x20;

### Criterion 12: Point system

This was added to the game, and I am very happy with how it came out. The game now has a visible reason to play that is addictive and maintains entertainment. It does not save the score but I prefer it working like this, allowing the player to have a fresh start and game every time that they die.&#x20;

### Criterion 13: Doesn't crash

The game has never crashed on me once I finished coding it. The game loads well in the right resolution for the screen. The closest the game will come to crashing is the massive input delay when the player loads the game on a resolution that is significantly larger than a default. This is a rare case and even then, the game doesn't crash but instead is slow.&#x20;

### Criterion 14: Help system

This is the criterion I am most annoyed that I did not add to the game, as I feel it adds a large ammount of interaction and assistance without being too tough to create. On the other hand, I do not believe the game misses it. The game is pretty simple overall, tips to the player would have been a possible irratation to better players after their first game or two, when they had realised what they are meants to do overall and what to avoid. However I still feel like one or two little help systems could have helped make the game feel more inclusive.&#x20;
