| Test               | Test Details                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | Can you easily see what the goal of the game is? Can you see where you are supposed to go? What you are supposed to do?                                                                                             |
| 2 - Efficient      | Are the controls self explanatory? Did you have any difficulty moving in the game? Was it self explanatory what to do when you died / wanted to play again?                                                         |
| 3 - Engaging       | Was the game fun? Would you play it again? Do you feel like you would want to beat your own score or someone else's? Did you like the simple art and the colour scheme?                                             |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Did you encounter any problems / errors when playing? Did anything game braking happen? Was there any points where the game was un smooth / choppy? If there was a problem how badly did it affect your experience? |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Was the game simple to pick up for the first time? Do you feel like you needed a guide or was it okay without? Do you feel that the game was running too quickly or getting too difficult too quickly?              |

Listed below are the results to the questions. I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation
