### Criterion 3: Interactions (world)

The function of testing criterion three is to see how the world handles interaction from both the player and the computer. It should be able to run as expected, causing the expected changes on any device in any situation.

To test this I loaded my game in many different sizes, zooming in and out and such controls from the player, mainly testing and putting a strain on the games html and the canvas function.&#x20;

* When loading the game as its own tab, it functions as expected- the game loads in a resolution that fits the screen, leaving no error bars and no area that something could be placed that the player couldn't see.&#x20;
* When using CTRL and Middle Mouse to scroll the web page out (zooming out) the page does not automatically fill the area left behind, instead remaining as the size it was. Whilst it would be nice if it automatically updated to fit, it still plays perfectly when zoomed out. I am happy with this result, as it shows the game is working on any situation I give it and would do the same if loaded on a larger / smaller screen.&#x20;
* One downside is that when zoomed out as far as Google Chrome (my browser used for testing) could take the page, there was a large input delay and the game ran incredibly slowly. Because the game is run off a system that makes the character move a set amount of pixels per tick that movement key is held, so when the screen is up to 100x larger (much more pixels) the player is moving incredibly slow. This makes the game much less fun but I believe that this is a very rare situation to be in.&#x20;

Overall I would say that this section works as expected- the computer handles the background situation well, despite the players interactions it maintains a working game, keeping the orange ellipse moving randomly and maintaining the hunt system from the hunter.&#x20;

### Criterion 4: Interactions (player)

The point of this criterion was to ensure that the player could fluidly interact with the game, in a way that was fun and promoted replay ability. I believe that the many changes I have made towards the end of my cycles (primarily bug and error fixing) has made this a much stronger pass than it would have been before.&#x20;

* When pressing multiple movement keys at the same time, the game handles it extremely well, moving the character as the keys are pressed. One problem with this is that if the player moves the character horizontally the movement system isn't normalised, meaning that the speed is added rather than picking one (If the movement left is 10 and up is 10, if both keys are held in tandem it will move at a speed of 20 rather than staying at 10). I still believe this works as expected though, as it moves the character, just faster than expected.&#x20;
* When trying to break out the map I found the player interaction with the world worked exactly as expected, leaving the player pressed up against the wall, with no area where the player could leave the map.
* The hunter interacts perfectly with the player in almost all circumstances- the only problem can arise when the player glances off the hunter, in which case the player may not be killed by the hunter due to some small issues with the hitbox of the fish, i.e. the tail sometimes not counting as part of the fish's hitbox.&#x20;

### Criterion 5: Camera

The point of this criteria was to ensure that the game was visible at all times and that the player had an easy time not only seeing the characters but also understanding what was going on.&#x20;

* The camera system works perfectly, thanks to it being a very easy system to implement / use. The camera never moves, locking onto one position (the centre of the screen) and keeping everything in sight.
* Even when zoomed out, the camera maintains its central position in the screen, keeping the game in view, if not centred.&#x20;

### Criterion 6: World design

This criterion is one I added to ensure that I had a nice environment for the player to move the character in but also one that the player could look at / into for a considerable amount of time.

* I feel like this criterion I passed one section but did not complete the other half. The section I passed was the fact that the background is simple and easy to look at, letting the player easily see where they are and still being neat and clean
* On the other hand I feel it is a very basic background and I would have liked to have had the time to add some more detail, but I prioritised the functionality of the game over the aesthetic section and I am glad I did as the game runs exactly as I wanted on the background.&#x20;

### Criterion 7: Collisions

Criterion 7 is important as it is a large part of the functionality of the game whilst also being an area that could suffer if not robust enough.&#x20;

* As commented on in the player and interactions criteria, I am annoyed with how the hitbox is sometimes inaccurate and it can allow the player to get away unscathed in a situation that should have killed the character.&#x20;
* On the other hand, I believe the collisions between the player and the computer are nearly perfect in the rest of the game; the orange ellipse disappears as expected on every interaction and satisfyingly gets harder to grab each and every time, the same with the character and the games walls / boundaries, reacting as expected and stopping the player.&#x20;

### Criterion 8: Controls

Here I was testing the robustness and functionality of the games (admittedly simple) controls. I wanted the game to handle the input of multiple controls at the same time, whilst also maintaining the low latency input system that I knew could happen as long as the players computer can run the game.&#x20;

* Upon inputting all the controls at the same time, the players character will either not move (if pressed perfectly at the same time) or will choose the last inputted control that is still held and move in that direction. What's nice is that when the keys are released, the character instantly stops travelling and remains motionless until the next input, at which point it will immediately start moving again.&#x20;
